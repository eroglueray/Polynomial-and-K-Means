# Polynomial-and-K-Means
Python code for polynomial regression (evaluation included) and K Means (Objective Function included)

The polynomial.py file will display the range of polynomials of 0,1,2,3,5,10 degrees and its evaluation.
The kmeans.py file will display relevant cluster/centroid data and display an objective function result of the minimum centroids in a given K range.

This has been created for an assignment for the machine learning module. Looking back, SKlearn would have been more beneficial for significantly shortening the code, however, this 'manual' approach does help for customisation to some degree.
